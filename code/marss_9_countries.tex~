  As mortality evolves, there are underlying slow changes, which
  cumulate over time, and there may also be transitory shocks. We can
  use the Lee-Carter model to produce a time series of the level of
  mortality over time. Then, we can compare models that include only
  the slow change to those that also include transitory shocks. The
  standard statistical model for transitory shocks  was designed for
  normally-distributed observational error in every period. A future task would be to try
  to fit a model aimed at modeling mortality shocks from epidimics,
  which might not occur ever year, may be assymetric, and have heavier
  tails. Applying the standard model, we can detect in some countries
  evidence of a more slowly evolving trend. But the model does not
  pick this up in countries like the United States, Russia, and
  Germany.

\section{Modeling}

We first estimate the Lee-Carter model, adjusting $k_t$ to match
$e_0$.

Our model for estimating the latent $k_t$ has ``observation error''.

\begin{equation}
  k_t^{observed} = k_t^{latent} + n_t
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  k_t^{latent} = k_{t-1}^{latent} + d + \epsilon_t
\end{equation}

The model has two features.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The observed value is the latent value plus ``noise'' $n_t$,
    which is assumed to be normally distirubted with constant variance
    and indpendent over $t$.

  \item The latent value evolves as a random walk with drift, with a
    fixed (deterministic) value of $d$.

\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

In Figure \ref{kt_panel_fig} we show the observed and latent $k_t$ for
9 countries in the Human Mortality Database. In some countries, such
as the United States, Russia, and West Germany, the latent level of
mortality is indistinguishable from the observed level. In the others, 
latent value is clearly a smoother version of the observed $k_t$. The
smoothing is particularly evident in France, Spain, and Sweden. Italy
and Japan are intermediate cases.
